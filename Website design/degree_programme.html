                        Computer Science is popularly known as one of The University of Sheffield's strength and it is very exact 
                        when I have self-experienced for about one semester here.

                        6 modules for the first semester and each of them appears to cover almost all aspects 
                        in this field, which will definitely equip me as well as other students with adequate
                        knowledge for our future career prospects. Moreover, the well-prepared lectures together
                        with considerate and professional lecturers also play a crucial role in helping students 
                        quickly comprehend new specilaised knowledge, especially to those are complete beginners 
                        like me.<br> Next, I will comment to further details on each module I have been taking.</span> <br>

                            <p>In this module, we will get started with using Ruby language. I find this language 
                                pretty similar to Java Programming language (<a class = "COM1003" href="#COM1003">COM1003: Java Programming</a>).
                                In this module, I have been able to practice frequently via Cordio and I have attempted 
                                to build a simple game using this programming language, which is really an interesting task.

                            <p>Just like the name of the course, we study the basis of the course, which will be used in an upgraded version
                                in some other courses. During the first lecture, I thought this module is jsut like normal Maths I have learnt 
                                before, but since the second lesson, I did realise that it would not simply be Maths,but way more sophisticated than that.
                                Although at some points I find COM1002 rather tricky, I feel it motivates me to think outside the box
                                yet still logically. In short, I will descirbe this module as "strange and familiar".

                            <p>Personally, though I am a complete beginner, I find this module the easiest to understand at first.
                                I am fond of the way the module lecturer organises lessons as well as exam timetable. Everything 
                                is extremely thorough and readibly visible, which is undoubtedly helpful for students.

                            <p>Out of all modules I am studying, this must be the toughest module, which I have to devote lots of time
                                to understand each lecture content and its essay-like style is absolutely not my cup of tea as well.

                            <p>Surprisingly, this module is totally different from my first impression.
                                Glimpsing of binary numbers, I was a bit worried as I just heard about but hardly knew anything 
                                about them. Later on, the further I engage into this module, the more comfortable I feel towards this course.
                                This turns out not as complicated as I imagined initially. However, my mentor did alert me that this 
                                module will just be nice and easy for the first semester, while in the next semester, everything will 
                                soon becomes more complex.

                            <p>This is another intriguing module and this website is the assignment of this module too. 
                                In COM1008, I learn how to create a website on my own for the first time. The absorbing part to 
                                me must be to work with CSS files, where I can free my "artistic bent"; nevertheless, I also need 
                                to upgrade my skills so as to meet my imagination, which will be a motivation for me to make progress
                                in this course.
